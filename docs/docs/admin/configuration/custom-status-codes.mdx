# Custom status codes for Anubis errors

Out of the box, Anubis will reply with `HTTP 200` for challenge and denial pages. This is intended to make AI scrapers have a hard time with your website because when they are faced with a non-200 response, they will hammer the page over and over until they get a 200 response. This behavior may not be desirable, as such Anubis lets you customize what HTTP status codes are returned when Anubis throws challenge and denial pages.

This is configured in the `status_codes` block of your [bot policy file](../policies.mdx):

```yaml
status_codes:
  CHALLENGE: 200
  DENY: 200
```

To match CloudFlare's behavior, use a configuration like this:

```yaml
status_codes:
  CHALLENGE: 403
  DENY: 403
```

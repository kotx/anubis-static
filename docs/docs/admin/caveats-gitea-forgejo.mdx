title: When using Caddy with Gitea/Forgejo
---

Gitea/Forgejo relies on the reverse proxy setting the `X-Real-Ip` header. Caddy does not do this out of the gate. Modify your Caddyfile like this:

```python
ellenjoe.int.within.lgbt {
  # ...
  # diff-remove
  reverse_proxy http://localhost:3000
  # diff-add
  reverse_proxy http://localhost:3000 {
    # diff-add
    header_up X-Real-Ip {remote_host}
  # diff-add
  }
  # ...
}
```

Ensure that Gitea/Forgejo have `[security].REVERSE_PROXY_TRUSTED_PROXIES` set to the IP ranges that Anubis will appear from. Typically this is sufficient:

```ini
[security]
REVERSE_PROXY_TRUSTED_PROXIES = 127.0.0.0/8,::1/128
```

However if you are running Anubis in a separate Pod/Deployment in Kubernetes, you may have to adjust this to the IP range of the Pod space in your Container Networking Interface plugin:

```ini
[security]
REVERSE_PROXY_TRUSTED_PROXIES = 10.192.0.0/12
```

title: Signed commits
---

Anubis requires developers to sign their commits. This is done so that we can have a better chain of custody from contribution to owner. For more information about commit signing, [read here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-commit-signing-in-git/).

We do not require GPG. SSH signed commits are fine. For an overview on how to set up commit signing with your SSH key, [read here](https://dev.to/ccoveille/git-the-complete-guide-to-sign-your-commits-with-an-ssh-key-35bg).
